/**
 * See Field.png on https://github.com/SpencerJ21/screenlib
 *
 * Each of the cube group names are in screen::cubeGroup,
 * each of the tower names are in screen::tower, and
 * each of the scoring zone names are in screen::scoringZone
 *
 * The numbers on the cube show the bit that represents them in their bitfield:
 * a 0 means it's looking at bit 0: 0b0000X
 * a 1 means it's looking at bit 1: 0b000X0
 * and so on.
 *
 * This is done so the presence of every cube in a group can be given by a number
 * say you want the cubes labeled 3, 1, and 0, the bitfield would be 0b01011
 *
 * For the stacks near the middle, the cubes in the stack but not on top, are still represented by
 * the bits that follow the top cube's bit (the 3 cubes under a cube on bit 3 are represented by
 * bits 2, 1, and 0)
 *
 * Alternatively, macros can be used for more verbose code; here is the equivalent of the previous
 * example: field.draw(screen::cubeGroup::right4, CUBE_HIGHEST + CUBE_2LOWEST);
 *
 * CUBE_HIGHEST represents the highest cube in the stack, followed by CUBE_2HIGHEST (the 2nd
 * highest), followed by CUBE_2LOWEST (the 2nd lowest), and finally CUBE_LOWEST As the 4 cube stacks
 * on the left and right are in the same order but slightly different positions
 *
 * CUBE_FAR and CUBE_NEAR are for the cube Groups farLeft and farRight
 *
 * CUBE_TOP_NEAR, CUBE_FAR_LEFT, CUBE_NEAR_LEFT, CUBE_FAR_RIGHT, and CUBE_NEAR_RIGHT are used for
 * the five cube stack on the near side
 *
 * and finally, all macros starting with TOWER_CUBE_ refer to the cubes around a tower
 *
 *
 * Scored cubes are drawn along with where they are, either in a tower or a scoring zone. In a tower
 * the second parameter describes the color of the cube, (screen::color::). In a scoring zone the
 * second parameter does the same however, two colors can be placed in an array to denote two
 * stacks. In addition, a third parameter is used to display "stack height", a number printed on top
 * to describe how many cubes are in the stack. Note: use `screen::color::none` to abstain from
 * printing a scored cube in that position
